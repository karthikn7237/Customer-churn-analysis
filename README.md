The management wants to identify the key factors contributing to customer churn and develop strategies to reduce churn rate and increase customer retention. The dataset provided includes information about customers, such as demographics, service usage, contract details, and customer churn status.

AIM: The challenge is to analyze this dataset using data analytics techniques and uncover insights that can help the company understand the drivers of churn and take proactive measures to retain customers.

- Data Transformation Here, I created Queries to organise data for better analysis and reporting.

Visualization â€” Report I started the report by creating a few DAX measures. DAX simply means Data Analysis Expression. It is an expression that helps with calculations while building report. I created various measures for the requirement of the visualization:
